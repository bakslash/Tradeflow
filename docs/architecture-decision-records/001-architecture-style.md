🧩 ADR 001 — Architecture Style

Title: Choose Microservices Architecture for Tradeflow
Date: 2025-10-21
Status: Accepted

Context

Tradeflow is a scalable trade management system that handles multiple independent services — product, order, and inventory. The system requires modularity, maintainability, and independent deployability.

Decision

I chose a Microservices Architecture using Spring Boot for each service to enable:

Independent scaling and deployment

Easier maintenance and testing

Clear separation of concerns

Consequences

✅ Easier feature iteration
✅ Teams can work independently
⚠️ Requires service orchestration (via API gateway and service registry)
⚠️ Higher operational overhead vs monolith
